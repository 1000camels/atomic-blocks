A collection of beautiful, customizable Gutenberg blocks for the new block editor.

== Description ==

Atomic Blocks is a collection of content blocks for the new [Gutenberg](https://atomicblocks.com/beginners-guide-gutenberg/?utm_source=WP.org%20Description%20Gberg%20Link&utm_campaign=wporg_desc_gberg_link) block editor. Blocks are chunks of content such as paragraphs, images, galleries, columns, and more. Building blocks give you more control to quickly create and launch any kind of site you want!

**Atomic Blocks is in early development and may not be suitable for production sites.** Because the new editor is still in production, breaking changes could be expected. Feel free to follow along and [contribute](https://github.com/ArrayHQ/atomic-blocks) to the development.

## Atomic Blocks currently includes the following blocks:

* Testimonial Block
* Inline Notice Block
* Accordion Block
* Share Icons Block
* Call-To-Action Block
* Customizable Button Block
* Spacer & Divider Block
* Author Profile Block
* Drop Cap Block
