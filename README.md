## Page building blocks for the new WordPress editor.

Atomic Blocks is a collection of "blocks" for the new WordPress block editor, also known as Gutenberg. Blocks are chunks of content such as paragraphs, images, galleries, columns, and more. Building with blocks gives you more control to quickly create and launch any kind of site you want!

Atomic Blocks is in early development, but feel free to follow along and contribute to the development.

## Atomic Blocks currently includes: 

* Testimonials
